            Over the course of past few years, <strong>Students' Alumni Cell</strong> has emerged
            as a key organ of the <strong>Office of Alumni Affairs and International Relations</strong>
            in executing its yearlong events and activities. Students' Alumni Cell
            continuously endeavours to strengthen the relations of the alumni of this
            Institute and their alma mater. <br>
            Formed as and operating under the Dean,
            Alumni Affairs and International Relations, Students' Alumni Cell has been

            publishing the quarterly alumni newsletter (<strong>KGPian</strong>), the annual literary
            magazine (<strong>Yearnings of Yore</strong>) and the <strong>Annual Yearbook</strong>. <br>
            Along with these, the
            Cell organises regular guest lectures by distinguished alumni via the
            initiatives <strong>"Guest Lecture Conclave"</strong> and the <strong>"E-Guest Lecture Series"</strong>. <br>
            Students' Alumni Cell also operates the
